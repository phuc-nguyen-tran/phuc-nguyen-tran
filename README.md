### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Nguyen, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Rochester. My interest lies in the intersection of Computer Science and Finance, as I want to use software development to assess real-time change in the financial market. My current focus is on full-stack software development, and I'm open to expanding my skill sets into different fields in the technology sections!

### Fun facts âš¡

I love sports, literally, any sports you can think of. I spend most of my Saturday/Sunday mornings watching my beloved Tottenham Hotspur (#COYS). I'm also a Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Angels fan. Watching my favorite teams play is tough, but here we are! Outside sports, I love polishing my fantasy sports team, binging reality shows, learning geography, and cooking not-so-good food.
