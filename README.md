### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Nguyen, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Rochester. My interest lies in the intersection of Computer Science and Finance, as I want to use software development to assess real-time change in the financial market. My current focus is on full-stack software development, and I'm open to expanding my skill sets into different fields in the technology sections!
